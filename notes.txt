MULT CHOICE GENERATION PROMPT

I have the following text that we need to convert to a multiple choice format.
The first line is a question
The next four line are possible answers
Each question is separated by a black line.

Here is the text of the questions.
`
The inventions in the video are mainly designed to:
Make the shop look nicer
Make auto repair tasks easier and faster
Replace all standard tools
Enter design competitions

A custom jig in an auto shop is used to:
Store paperwork
Hold or position parts securely
Change engine oil
Clean the floor

One benefit of using specialized tools is
More guesswork
Increased risk of damage
Greater precision and control
Slower repairs

Many of the inventions in the video are made from:
Gold and silver
Simple, readily available materials
Only factory‑made kits
Plastic toys

Safety is important with homemade tools because they:
Are always perfectly tested
Can fail if poorly built or misused
Never break
Are only decorative

A good shop invention should:
Make the job more complicated
Be unsafe but fast
Solve a specific problem effectively
Replace all safety equipment

One common purpose of lifting or support devices is to:
Paint the vehicle
Safely hold heavy components in place
Check tire pressure
Clean windows

Custom organizers or racks in a shop help by:
Hiding tools
Making tools harder to find
Keeping tools and parts easy to access
Reducing storage space

A time‑saving invention in a repair shop usually:
Reduces the number of steps in a task
Adds extra unnecessary steps
Makes the job slower
Only changes the colour of tools

The video encourages viewers to:
Ignore problems and work harder
Think creatively about solving shop challenges
Avoid using any special tools
Stop maintaining equipment

Please convert the above text to HTML markup using the following format:
  <ol type="1">
    <li class="mcItem">
      (first question)
      <ol type="A">
        <li>(first option)</li>
        <li>(second option)</li>
        <li>(third option)</li>
        <li>(fourth option)</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

  </ol>

*** Knowledge & Understanding Answers
Now I'd like to do the same thing for another section, here's a sample of the HTML for it:
`
<div class="k-and-u-answers">
  <h3>Knowledge & Understanding (Answers)</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>What are the four strokes of the engine cycle?</p>
      <p class="k-and-u-answer">
        Intake, Compression, Power, and Exhaust
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Why is valve timing important?</p>
      <p class="k-and-u-answer">
        It ensures valves open and close at the right time for efficient combustion.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>What part ignites the air‑fuel mixture?</p>
      <p class="k-and-u-answer">
        The spark plug.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>What does the crankshaft do??</p>
      <p class="k-and-u-answer">
        Converts piston motion into rotation.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Why is compression necessary?</p>
      <p class="k-and-u-answer">
        It increases the energy released during combustion.
      </p>
    </li>
</div>
`

The buttons used the attribute "data-mc="HJZXHfs0fgA"
Can we set up the same functionaliy for the 'k-and-u-answers' div?
*** END Knowledge & Understanding Answers

*** ENTIRE SECTION HTML GENERATION

The entire section would be contained in these tags:
<section class="lesson">

</section>

The first div within the section will be:
`
<div class="lessonHeader">

  <h3>video title</h3>
  <a href="(url)" target="_blank"
    >(url)</a

The second div within the section will be:
`
<div class="summary">
  <h3>Summary of the Video</h3>
  <p>

The third div within the section will be:
`
<div class="k-and-u">
  <h3>Knowledge & Understanding</h3>

    <li>(k-and-u item)</li>
    <li>(k-and-u item)</li>
    <li>(k-and-u item)</li>
</div>
`

The fourth div within the section will be:
`
<div class="k-and-u-answers">
  <h3>Knowledge & Understanding (Answers)</h3>

  <button class="btn-ku-answers">Show Answers</button>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>(first question)</p>

The fifth div within the section will be:
`
<div class="multchoice">
  <h3>Multiple Choice Questions</h3>

  <button class="btn-mc-questions">Show Questions</button>

  (The multiple choice question formatted as we've been doing them)
  <ol type="1">
    <li class="mcItem">
      (question text)
      <ol type="A">
        <li>(multiple choice item)</li>
        <li>(multiple choice item)</li>

      </ol>
    </li>
    .
