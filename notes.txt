MULT CHOICE GENERATION PROMPT

I have the following text that we need to convert to a multiple choice format.
The first line is a question
The next four line are possible answers
Each question is separated by a black line.

Here is the text of the questions.
`
What is the main purpose of the intake stroke?
To ignite the fuel
To draw in the air‑fuel mixture
To expel exhaust gases
To compress the mixture

What part ignites the air‑fuel mixture?
Valve
Piston
Spark plug
Crankshaft

What happens during the compression stroke?
Exhaust gases leave the cylinder
The piston moves down
The mixture is squeezed into a smaller space
The spark plug fires

What causes the piston to move down in the power stroke?
Combustion explosion
Gravity
Exhaust pressure
Valve timing

What is the crankshaft responsible for?
Opening the valves
Mixing fuel and air
Converting piston motion into rotation
Cooling the engine

What is the purpose of the exhaust stroke?
To bring in fresh air
To remove burned gases
To ignite the mixture
To lubricate the piston

Why do engines often have multiple cylinders?
To reduce emissions
To improve smoothness and balance
To increase spark plug life
To reduce oil use

What does displacement measure?
The size of the spark plug
The total volume of all cylinders
The weight of the engine
The amount of exhaust produced

What does torque represent?
Rotational force
Engine temperature
Fuel efficiency
Air pressure

Which stroke directly produces power?
Intake
Compression
Power
Exhaust

Please convert the above text to HTML markup using the following format:
  <ol type="1">
    <li class="mcItem">
      (first question)
      <ol type="A">
        <li>(first option)</li>
        <li>(second option)</li>
        <li>(third option)</li>
        <li>(fourth option)</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    .
    .
    .

  </ol>

  *** MULT CHOICE button
I need a button to show the answers to multiple choice sections.

There will be many of these so I need a way to differentiate each buttons section from all the other buttons (and answer sections)

I was thinking of using button id's and matching classes for the multiple choice answers as follows.
`
<div class="multchoiceAnswers">
  <h3>Multiple Choice Answers</h3>
  <button class="btn-mc-answers" id="HJZXHfs0fgA">Show Answers</button>
  <ol class="HJZXHfs0fgA" type="1">
    <li>B</li>
    <li>C</li>
    <li>C</li>
    <li>A</li>
    <li>C</li>
    <li>B</li>
    <li>B</li>
    <li>B</li>
    <li>A</li>
    <li>C</li>
  </ol>
</div>
`

Then I would use javaScript to toggle the classes for matching button id's.
Is this the most efficient way of doing this?

(Saved old code)
<div class="multchoiceAnswers">
  <h3>Multiple Choice Answers</h3>
  <button class="btn-mc-answers" id="HJZXHfs0fgA">Show Answers</button>
  <ol class="HJZXHfs0fgA" type="1">
    <li>B</li>
    <li>C</li>
    <li>C</li>
    <li>A</li>
    <li>C</li>
    <li>B</li>
    <li>B</li>
    <li>B</li>
    <li>A</li>
    <li>C</li>
  </ol>
</div>

*** Knowledge & Understanding Answers
Now I'd like to do the same thing for another section, here's a sample of the HTML for it:
`
<div class="k-and-u-answers">
  <h3>Knowledge & Understanding (Answers)</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>What are the four strokes of the engine cycle?</p>
      <p class="k-and-u-answer">
        Intake, Compression, Power, and Exhaust
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Why is valve timing important?</p>
      <p class="k-and-u-answer">
        It ensures valves open and close at the right time for efficient combustion.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>What part ignites the air‑fuel mixture?</p>
      <p class="k-and-u-answer">
        The spark plug.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>What does the crankshaft do??</p>
      <p class="k-and-u-answer">
        Converts piston motion into rotation.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Why is compression necessary?</p>
      <p class="k-and-u-answer">
        It increases the energy released during combustion.
      </p>
    </li>
</div>
`

The buttons used the attribute "data-mc="HJZXHfs0fgA"
Can we set up the same functionaliy for the 'k-and-u-answers' div?
